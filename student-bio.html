                <p>Hello, my name is Oliver, and I like to stay hydrated. Hydration is one of the most important parts of my life. 
                    I don't know where I'd be if it weren't for that tasty, cool, clear stuff A.K.A. Water.</p>
                <p>Please go and drink some water right now. Yes, you reading this. Get some water. Please. I beg you. 
                    I will not rest until everyone in this world is perfectly hydrated, and there's nothing you or anyone else can do to stop me.</p>
